# Who Tweeted What?

This is a web application that uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning model to analyze the textual content of tweets and predict which of two Twitter users most likely authored a user-generated text.

## Functionality
The application allows clients to select two Twitter users and enter tweet text. Based on the textual content of the tweet, the application predicts which user is more likely to have authored the tweet. Additionally, clients can request the addition of new Twitter users, and after submission, their tweets are added to the database, making them available for our predictive model.

## Deployment
To deploy the application, simply run the following command:
`python app.py`

This will launch the application on your local machine. To access the application, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
